# Advice / Best Practices

**Learning objectives:**

- THESE ARE NICE TO HAVE BUT NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY

## SLIDE 1 {-}

- ADD SLIDES AS SECTIONS (`##`).
- TRY TO KEEP THEM RELATIVELY SLIDE-LIKE; THESE ARE NOTES, NOT THE BOOK ITSELF.

## Meeting Videos {-}

### Cohort 1 {-}

00:18:44	Lydia Gibson:	At first glance I didn‚Äôt realize how confusing the colors of the bars were. I was wondering why it had provided a legend but that‚Äôs why

00:22:08	Ken Vu:	There's a website where you can find the hex code for the color you want.  Sometimes, the default colors may not work best so you can use the link below to customize your color and get the hex code for it to use in R
